# Cryptocurrency-Market-Trend-Sentiment-Analysis

## **Project Overview:**

In the ever-volatile cryptocurrency market, investors and traders face a daunting challenge: navigating the complex web of market trends, sentiment, and trading volumes to make informed decisions. With thousands of data points to analyze, identifying patterns and opportunities can be a Herculean task. 

The objective of this project is to provide actionable insights into market trend and sentiment for investors and traders in the cryptocurrency market having analysed the 17500 hourly data points..


**Dataset Source:** This analysis was conducted using a simulated Dataset from Kaggle.

**Tools Used:** SQL


## **The Challenge:**

Seeing the cryptocurrency market is known for its rapid price fluctuations and sentiment shifts, making it a challenging space to navigate. Some of the key questions I aimed to address include:

1. What are the key drivers of market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space, and how do they impact price movements?

2. Can we identify patterns in trading volume and price movements that would enable investors to make more informed decisions?

3. How does the cryptocurrency market respond to changes in grid levels, and what implications does this have for investment strategies?

4. What role does Bitcoin play in shaping market sentiment, and how does its trading volume impact the broader cryptocurrency market?

5. How can investors use sentiment analysis and market trend insights to optimize their investment strategies and minimize risk?


## **My Approach:**

I meticulously cleaned, validated, and structured the raw, heterogeneous data directly within the database environment. This involved identifying and rectifying inconsistencies, managing missing values, and establishing clear relational structures essential for accurate analysis.


I utilized a suite of SQL's powerful aggregate functions (e.g., AVG, COUNT), grouping capabilities (GROUP BY), and filtering clauses (WHERE) to uncover hidden patterns and trends across numerous key dimensions.


I formulated and directly validated critical business hypotheses through the construction of complex, multi-layered SQL queries. This iterative process allowed for rapid testing of assumptions and the extraction of deeper, more nuanced insights into  market drivers.

A glimpse of the logic and methodology for the 3rd Insight


You can explore the code to understand the precise logic and methodology behind these insights [Here](https://github.com/David-TheAnalyst/Cryptocurrency-Market-Trend-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/Cryptocurrency%20Qweries..sql).


## **Key Insights:**

1. Despite being a market leader, Bitcoin (BTC) has the lowest traded volume among the six cryptocurrencies (Etherium, Dogecoin, Solana, Ripple, Binance Coin) analyzed.

2. Dogecoin dominates weekend trading: Dogecoin's trading volume spikes on weekends, indicating a unique market dynamic.

3. The 14th hour of the day sees the highest trading volume, suggesting a potential window for traders.

4. Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are peak trading days for Bitcoin.

5. Bitcoin  is the lowest traded cryptocurrency during low and high greed periods: 

6. Dogecoin is the top traded cryptocurrency during high and low greed periods. 

7. Average BTC trading volume is 933.52A baseline for understanding market fluctuations.

8. Monday and Tuesday are high-volume days for Bitcoin.


## **Recommendation:**

1. Investors should consider allocating a portion of their portfolio to Dogecoin during periods of high greed, as it has historically demonstrated strong performance and resilience. However, it's essential to monitor market trends and adjust allocations accordingly to minimize potential risks.

2. The data suggests that Bitcoin's low trading volume during high and low greed periods presents an opportunity for investors to re-evaluate their portfolio allocations. Consider diversifying into other cryptocurrencies that have shown more robust trading activity during these periods, such as Dogecoin.


3. We observed a notable trend in the 14th hour of the day, where trading volumes tend to peak. Investors should want to consider leveraging 14th hour of the day insightinsight to optimize their trading strategies, potentially capitalizing on increased market activity during this time window.

4. Since Bitcoin trading volume tends to decline on weekends, and Dogecoin trading volume seems to be at its peak, diversifying the portfolio to include Dogecoin could provide opportunities for growth.


## **Skills Demonstrated:**

1. Data Analysis (SQL): Advanced querying, aggregation, filtering, and data manipulation.

2. Data Storytelling & Interpretation

3. Problem Solving

4. Strategic Recommendation


## **Conclusion:** 

The findings demonstrate the power of data-driven analysis to uncover market truths and move beyond generic assumptions. The analytical framework developed here serves as a valuable, repeatable tool for making more informed and strategic decisions in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape.
